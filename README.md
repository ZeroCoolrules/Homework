###### I enjoy learning  learn new things. I like to challenge myself. You can say that I am a bit of an enigma. But in the same cohort I am pretty much an open book. I'm hoping to become a freelance tester  and will end up being a senior software developer.

1. I hope to master Java Script
2. I hope to use my capstone to help small businesses
3. I hope to solidify myself as a Jr. Web Developer
4. I hope to complete the Boot Camp
